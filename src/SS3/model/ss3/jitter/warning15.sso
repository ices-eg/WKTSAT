Warning 1 : At least one block pattern ends in endyr. Check the output parameter value time series to see if the values in forecast years are as intended.
Note 1 Suggestion: Are you sure you want so few early recrdevs? Better to include in range of main recdevs 4
Warning 2 : Final gradient: 31273.7 is larger than final_conv: 0.0001
Warning 3 : Main recdev biasadj is >2 times ratio of rmse to sigmaR
Warning 4 : Early recdev biasadj is >2 times ratio of rmse to sigmaR
Note 2 Information: A revised protocol for the Fcast_yr specification is available and recommended.
Note 3 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 1; check results, variance may be suspect
